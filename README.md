`grobidmonkey` is built to handle TEI XML files generated by GROBID. It provides a reader class that converts these files into Python dictionaries, making them simple to read and work with. The grobidmonkey reader is capable of reading the entire essay as a dictionary, where each key represents section titles and the corresponding values are lists of section contents in paragraphs. Also the reader provides a method for reading the outline of essay as a tree.

### Installation

```python
pip install grobidmonkey
```

### Quick Start

```python
from grobidmonkey import reader
monkeyReader = reader.MonkeyReader('monkey') # or 'lxml' or 'x2d'

# read paper outline
outline = monkeyReader.readOutline('path/to/your/paper.pdf.tei.xml')

# read paper content
essay = monkeyReader.readEssay('/home/com3dian/Downloads/2308.13067.pdf.tei.xml')
```
